---->   Total number of spanning tree in graphs.

If a graph is a complete graph with n vertices, then total number of spanning trees is n(n-2) where n is the number of nodes in the graph.

Otherwise----->

1. Create Adjacency Matrix for the given graph.
2.  Replace all the diagonal elements with the degree of nodes.
3.  Replace all non-diagonal 1’s with -1.
4.  Replace all non-diagonal 1’s with -1.
5.  The cofactor that you get is the total number of spanning tree for that graph.
