----> Total number of spanning tree in graphs.

If a graph is a complete graph with n vertices, then total number of spanning trees is n to power (n-2) where n is the number of nodes in the graph.

Otherwise----->

Create Adjacency Matrix for the given graph.
Replace all the diagonal elements with the degree of nodes.
Replace all non-diagonal 1’s with -1.
Replace all non-diagonal 1’s with -1.
The cofactor that you get is the total number of spanning tree for that graph.
